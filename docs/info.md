## How it works

TBD. Right now it is simply a 3-bit adder outputting a 4-bit number.

## How to test

There are two sets of inputs IN0-IN2 and IN4-IN6, there are the two 3-bit numbers that are added.
The output bits are OUT0-OUT3, a 4-bit number.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
